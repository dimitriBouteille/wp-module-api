WordPress module designed for developers that want to add routes to the [WordPress Rest API](https://developer.wordpress.org/rest-api/) in a few moments.

> ðŸ’¡ To simplify the integration of this library, we recommend using WordPress with one of the following tools: [Bedrock](https://roots.io/bedrock/), [Themosis](https://framework.themosis.com/) or [Wordplate](https://github.com/wordplate/wordplate#readme).

## Documentation

If you want to know more about how the WordPress API works, you can [read the WordPress documentation](https://developer.wordpress.org/rest-api/) :)

You can find all the documentation in the [wiki](https://github.com/dimitriBouteille/wp-module-rest-api/wiki).

## Installation

### Requirements
